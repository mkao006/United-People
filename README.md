# United People 

This is a repository containing ideas of setting up a new NGO which
aims at connecting every single individual helping solving the most
difficult problems in the world.

## Vision

To achieve a world with no poverty, hunger by connecting every citizen
of this planet to form a global volunteer network.

## Mission Statement

There are limitations to everything, including our
governments. Observing this limitation, we want to expand the capacity
by providing a platform allowing every global citizen to have a chance
to help those who are in need even with the smallest involvement.


## Why Do We Need Such an NGO

Financially, the United Nations has a budget of 5.512 billion USD for
the 2012-13 bi-annum; this is equivalent to only 0.38 USD per year per
person. Collecting survey may cost millions of dollar, but individuals
can assist the data collection by means of online-technology. Numbeo
collects food prices at the consumer level, a statistic vital to
resolving hunger yet not collected by the United Nations.

## How Do we make the involvements

A strong emphasis in the use of modern technology, this will reduce
the cost of running the organization.

* Policy recommendation engine - This will serve as the core of the
  platform. The engine will be open source and reside on Github for
  everyone to contribute.

* Online Competition - A Kaggle like online competition which skilled
  people around the world can collaborate to provide evidence based
  decision making.

* Peer Review - Stackoverflow like evaluation to assess the best
  solution and draw interest by means of gamification.

* Donation - Kickstarter project like funding programe, with donation
  are resricted to 1$ per day per person, to emphasize that we need
  everyone oppose to a single powerful force. This will also draw
  donors to return frequently.

* Feedback - Using media to connect the helper with those being
  helped. Providing a real life like connection for helpers to see how
  their contribution is making a change.
