# United People 

This is a repository containing ideas of setting up a new NGO which
aims at connecting every single individual helping solving the most
difficult problems in the world.

## Vision

To achieve a world with no poverty, hunger by connecting every citizen
of this planet to form a global volunteer network.

## Mission Statement

There are limitations to everything, including our
governments. Observing this limitation, we want to expand the capacity
by providing a platform allowing every global citizen to have a chance
to help those who are in need even with the smallest involvement.


## Why Do We Need Such an NGO

We want the people who are in need to express their problems, and
provide connection to those with the skills and resources to help
them. Most NGOs and governments does not have the resources nor
capacities to observe every single aspect of those who are in
need. Information are lost at every single level of communication,
thus, we believe providing a forum directly linking to the one who are
in need will minimize the loss of information.

Need to think about how to restrict the questions and projects without
losing focus. 

## How Do we make the involvements

A strong emphasis in the use of modern technology, this will reduce
the cost of running the organization.

* Policy recommendation engine - This will serve as the core of the
  platform. The engine will be open source and reside on Github for
  everyone to contribute. Even helping your own country will help
  other country position theirself.

* Online Competition - A Kaggle like online competition which skilled
  people around the world can collaborate to provide evidence based
  decision making. Individuals who reside in the country or are
  associate with the problem can provide more insight through the
  forum.

* Peer Review - Stackoverflow like evaluation to assess the best
  solution and draw interest by means of gamification.

* Donation - Kickstarter project like funding programe, with donation
  are resricted to 1$ per day per person, to emphasize that we need
  everyone oppose to a single powerful force. This will also draw
  donors to return frequently.

* Feedback - Using media to connect the helper with those being
  helped. Providing a real life like connection for helpers to see how
  their contribution is making a change.


* Ranking Importance - People around the world can vote and decide
  what are the most burning issue this platform should focus and
  solve.

* Volunteer translator - People facing severe basic right problem may
  not communicate in a global language or access to internet. People
  can contribute by translating the message and provide access to
  the forum.

## Actions Required To Set Up The NGO

* A Board

* Set up the head quarter in Taiwan.

* Programmers or collaboration with Kaggle and Stackoverflow to
  develope a prototype.
